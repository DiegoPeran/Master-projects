    "We have created the following function to return the words of a string. First, the function removes all characters of the original string that are not letters or ' (to include words like don't, it's, etc.). Second, the function splits the string (clean out of forbidden characters) using the space separator (i.e. it separates words). Third, if a particular string (word), was contained in the original string, the function includes it in a new list. This last point is included to avoid inserting words in certain situations. For instance we find the following string on a message: \"cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu\"; our function would delete the forbidden characters and it would become: \"cantaloupesrvcscmuedu\"; if we do not incldue that last if sentence, this word would be included in the list without sense. It has also inconvenients; for instance, a word like \"non-umpleasant\" will be excluded, since the function will remove \"-\" and the word \"nonumpleasant\" would not be included in the original string.

    "For creating a matrix with the word counts, we proceed as follows. First, we create a matrix of 0's with the number of rows equal to the number of messages (in this case, 40) and as columns as different words are in our 40 messages (it varies since it is generated randomly). Then we iterate first for every message, and then for every column (different word). Now we access the i-th dictionary of our list of dictionaries \"countMessages\", and we introduce in the j-th column, the number of counts of that word in that message. \n",

    "We have done this process with two different notations, to work a bit further. The first one consists on iterate over the words contained in the set \"uniqueWords\" and thus it is necessary to label \"j\" with increasing numbers to introduce it in the matrix. Then we acces the dictionary i-th and ask for the value of the key=\"word\" (if it is not included in that dictionary, since it is a default dictionary with lambda:0, it leaves the 0 in the matrix). The second one iterates from 0 to the (number of total unique words-1) for every message. Then, we have to acces the dictionary with the corresponding word of the set \"uniqueMessages\", for which we have to transform it to a list, and access the element j-th."

    "In order to compute the matrix of ratios, we can use broadcasting properties of Python. We can compute the division of all elements of a row by the total sum of that row dividing the matrix (40x(number of unique words)) by the vector of total sums (40x1). This operation will act as it were (40x(number of unique words)) / \"(40x(number of unique words))\" where the second denominator term is a matrix containing repetitions of the vector of total sums in each colum. Therefore, it will do the division element by element, which results in a matrix where all elements of the same row are divided by the total sum of the elements of that row (i.e. by the total number of words in that message --> proportions of each word in each message).\n",
